A web application with modules distributed on different static web servers around the world and maintained by different people with different skills.  

* All modules are open source, reusable and are able to be hosted on any static web server.  
* Business data and files are stored in business owner's private database and storage.  
* Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client side. No server side coding.  
* All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTP with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.
