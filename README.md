Collect, manage and maintain your business data and tracking your business activities.

I build this website for demonstrating 3 concepts.  

* 1. Modular distributed microservices
Can we build a web applications with shared reusable modules distributed on different static web servers around the world and maintained by different people with different skills (jQuery,ReactJS,AngulaJS etc)?
* 2. A Network linking business's data together like 'Facebook' linking people's social media data  
Facebook services let people be linked together (linking unstructured data). Is there any possibility to help business owners to link their business together for collaboration (linking structured data)?
* 3. A SaaS (Software as a service) network
Can we build a SaaS network where the microservices can be linked together to help business owners to build a business portal solution?


This website is built with the following key features:

* Modular distributed –– scalable, flexible, reusable and easy replaceable
* Microservices –– service oriented architecture (SOA)
* Single page application (SPA) –– fast response, better user experience
* Static web hosting from anywhere –– fast, secure and low cost or free (using GitHub+CloudFlare free services)
* No server side coding –– simple development and easy maintenance
* Data access with APIs –– directly read/write data from/to a cloud database with APIs
* File access with APIs –– directly download/upload files from/to Amazon S3 storage with APIs
