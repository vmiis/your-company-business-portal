I build this website for demonstrating 3 concepts.  

* Modular distributed web application.  
Building web applications with shared reusable modules distributed on different static web servers around the world and maintained by different people with different skills (jQuery,ReactJS,AngulaJS,Bootstrap etc).
* A Network linking business's data together like 'Facebook' linking people's social media data  
Facebook services let people be linked together (linking unstructured data). Is there any possibility to help business owners to link their business together (linking structured data)?
* A SaaS (Software as a service) network.  
Applications in Google Play have no data sharing functions.	Can we build a SaaS network where the apps have a common data sharing interface?


Do you have any modular based pages and want to be connected to this "Virtual Company Portal?
