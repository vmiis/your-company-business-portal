				<span style="color:#000000;font-size:36px">Frequently Asked Questions</span><br><br>
				<span style="font-weight:bold;">1. What is the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research</span><br><br>
				The Woolcock Institute is an inter-disciplinary research institute dedicated to understanding and treating respiratory and sleep disorders. With over 200 research and clinical professionals, we are a world leader in the area of research, clinical diagnosis and treatment. We are affiliated with the University of Sydney.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span style="font-weight:bold;">2. Where is the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research?&nbsp;</span><br>
				<br>
				The Woolcock Institute is located at 431 Glebe Point Road in the Suburb of Glebe in Sydney, NSW, Australia. If you are enrolled in this research study, you will need to attend appointments at this location.&nbsp;<br>
				<br>
				The Woolcock Institute can be reached on the 431 bus from the Sydney CBD. This service stops directly outside the Woolcock. The 433 and 370 buses also stop a short distance away as does the light rail (Jubilee Park Stop)<br>
				<br>
				Alternatively, if you wish to drive to the Woolcock, we can arrange a free secure car park in the institute<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span style="font-weight:bold;">3. What is the Purpose of this study?&nbsp;</span><br>
				<br>
				Communities living near wind turbines have presented with a cluster of health symptoms sometimes called "Wind Turbine Syndrome". The National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) have recently conducted a thorough review and did not find any scientifically robust studies that could definitively prove or disprove whether wind turbine noise causes human ill-health. Wind turbines generate noise that is below the audible range for humans (called infrasound) and nobody has yet conducted a scientific study in a laboratory to determine whether it has any effects on humans. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether 72 hours of wind turbine noise has effects on human health measures when compared to silence and to traffic noise.<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span style="font-weight:bold;">4. Am I eligible to participate in this study?</span>&nbsp;<br>
				<br>
				Eligible participants are adults with normal hearing who report they are at least somewhat sensitive to noise and are willing to stay in our sleep centre for 3 weeks. Our online screening questionnaire will determine whether you meet the full eligibility criteria.&nbsp;<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<span style="font-weight:bold;">5. What will the research involve?&nbsp;</span><br>
				<br>
				This study will consist of 3 visit which will be separated by at least 11 days; each visit will consist of 4 consecutive days (i.e. 10am Friday to Noon Monday) where we will undertake a range of health-related measurements (sleep, brain activity, reaction time, memory, heart rate and blood samples etc. ) whilst in the background we will play 3 types of noise to you.&nbsp;<br>
				<br>
				The 3 types of noise are loud traffic noise which will probably interrupt your sleep, simulated wind turbine noise (infrasound - which you will not be able to hear) and silence.&nbsp;<br>
				<br>
				<span style="font-weight:bold;">6. Will I get paid for participating in this research?&nbsp;</span><br>
				<br>
				We will reimburse all your travel costs and we will pay for all your meals while you are with us. In addition, at the end of the study you will be reimbursed for your time.&nbsp;<br>
				<br>
				<span style="font-weight:bold;">7. What are the benefits of this study?</span><br>
				<br>
				There are no direct benefits to you by participating in this study. You may learn some interesting things about your sleep and other health measurements which you will be able to see on request. Your participation in this study will help in guiding future public policy about the health effects of wind turbines and traffic noise.&nbsp;<br>
