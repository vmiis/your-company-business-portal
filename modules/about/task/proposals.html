    				Business data sharing and collaboration between people (staff, clients, business partners, service providers, managers, board members...) are necessary for business success.
    		        With one login and permissions from business data owner everyone can involve business activities.
    		        Add what you need, remove what you donâ€™t need. Every part can be customised.
    		        I am happy to build business portal for you if you have some business data to manage and you can describe the way or the logic you manage the data.
    		        I am also happy to help people to move business data in spreadsheets to cloud for data collaboration (such as data entry and data reporting).
    		        I would like to build a system to link more and more business data together so as to make business operation, management and collaboration easier, faster and more efficient.

    	            	The potential success is to build an app store like Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Millions of developers build reusable open sources modules (like building linux modules) and business owner or manager can easy construct a cloud based business management system. This will make hundreds of millions office workers to use the system for daily business processing.
