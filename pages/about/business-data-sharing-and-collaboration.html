			<h3>Business data sharing and collaboration</h3>
			<hr style='border-top:1px solid #f05f40; margin:12px 0'></hr>
			Facebook services let people be linked together. Linkedin services let professional
			people be linked together. There are many other similar services but most of them
			help people share “unstructured data”, like photo, comments, files etc. I am keep
			thinking that is there any possibility to help business owners to link or share their
			business data together?  One example may be like this. If I am running a business
			and have a database that contains client’s information like name, phone number and
			home address, how can I share these information with a delivery company the people
			over there do not need to re-entry these data into their tracking database system, and also how
			they can let me to see the tracking information about my clients. If there is a
			company that provides a business data hosting service and both my company and the
			delivery company use this service, definitely this will become possible.
			I am sure this type of services or a new “Facebook” company will become available
			in the future. In order to provide a data hosting services with the functions we mentioned above,
			we must think of how to organize the data so we can apply a very flexible data reference permission controls.
			 I have spend many years to build a system that let people to
			share “structured data” together, so as to make the business data sharing and collaboration
			between different business become more efficient. I am happy to demonstrate this idea if you
			have interest and to show what I have done.
