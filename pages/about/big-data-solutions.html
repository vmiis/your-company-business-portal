			<h3>Big data solutions</h3>

			Big data is a term that may have a very wide meaning. Here what I am
			talking about the 'Big' data is the database tables have a large number
			of records.	One of the typical business report is an aggregation query
			for something total, such as total of sales, total of income etc.
			it is very expensive to generate aggregation reports in real time because
			we need to process all records in the table. We must find a solution to
			balance the gig data and the real time. The solution I am using in some
			applications is to generate some partial aggregation (for example a day,
			a month or a quarter) and save it as middle results. When we need a big
			aggregation (for example a year or all records in the database), we can
			use these middle results for aggregation so as to make it available in real
			time. The drawback is that if one or more original records modified, or we
			add new records, we need to reprocess the corresponding partial aggregations,
			but this can be done instantly by trigging another process or automatically
			process in a fixed period. We usually process the partial aggregations in
			midnight. This will make the query reflect the results a day ago. In many
			situations this is good enough. For example if a manager wants to know the
			total sales of this year, the results actually does not cover the changes
			since the midnight.
