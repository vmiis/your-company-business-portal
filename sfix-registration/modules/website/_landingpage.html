                      <p>We invite you to join a research study to test a new smartphone application that aims to help people with their sleep. This study will involve completing a short questionnaire asking about your sleep to determine eligibility. Depending on your answers, you may be invited to attend the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research for a medical screening and consent to the study. If eligible, you will receive the smartphone application and a wearable device (FitBit) to monitor your sleep over a 3 week study.  A final visit to see a sleep clinician and research staff is required to complete the study.</p>
                      <p>This research is being run by the Cooperative Research Centre for Alertness, Safety and Productivity. This is an initiative funded by the Australian Federal Government and industry partners with the aim of improving sleep health as well as improving workplace safety and productivity of all Australians.
