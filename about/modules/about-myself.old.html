                <b>My goal</b>
                <ul>
                One of my goals is to create an open source modular distributed cloud business operating system with the following features.
                  <ul>
                  <li>All modules should be open source, reusable and should be able to be hosted on any static web server.</li>
                  <li>Business data and files should be stored in business owner's private database and storage.</li>
                  <li>No server side coding for business logic. All business logic should be implemented on client side with javascript</li>
                  </ul>
                  It would be greatly appreciated if you could help me find sponsors to keep my concept further developed. I am working hard to contribute bit by bit everyday... towards my goal!
