				<h3>About this website</h3>
				<hr style='border-top:1px solid #f05f40; margin:12px 0'></hr>
				<b>I build this website for demonstrating the concept of modular distributed single page application with the following features.</b>
				<ul>
					<li>All modules are open source, reusable and are able to be hosted on any static web server.</li>
					<li>Business data and files are stored in business owner's private database and storage.</li>
                    <li>Any dynamic programming during the request/response cycle is handled by JavaScript, running entirely on the client side. No server side coding</li>
                    <li>All server-side processes or database actions are abstracted into reusable APIs, accessed over HTTP with JavaScript. These can be custom-built or leverage third-party services.</li>


				</ul>
